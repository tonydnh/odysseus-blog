### Telemachus [^1]

I made it. By the will of the Gods and the hand of fate, I have landed in rocky Ithaca, the home I’ve been absent from for two long decades. My family has grown without me, and now it was time to unite this family and my city. 

I made it to my old swineherd and friend Eumaeus’ place but dressed as an old wrinkly beggar not to blow my cover. We had friendly chats, and then came my great son Telemachus! I have not seen my boy since he was a little baby. He is so big and muscular now after his father, but I had to hold back the strongest urges to hug my own son because of my disguise.

God knows how my son has grown up without a father figure and having to deal with those dirty suitors, but I was just so glad to see him again. After Eumaeus left for town, I revealed myself with the guidance of Athena. 

Our hug was surrounded by a waterfall of built up tears as I felt the warmth of family I could not feel in the Underworld. My son initially backed off, not believing my reveal, but quickly came back in for another warm hug after an explanation. From when I was trapped on Calypso’s island, never would I have imagined myself back home with my own son plotting to take back my throne. 

Leaving home was a product of war, but I hold regret in my heart for my absence in Telemachus’ childhood and not being able to show him the ways of life as I learned from my father before me. I can’t control the past, but I can control the present and prepare my son for the life ahead of him. I knew to feel grateful for the hug and to come back into my son’s life.

### Penelope [^2]

Arriving at my former palace as a beggar, I was once again captivated by the beauty and charm of my beloved wife Penelope, whose same qualities made me fall over and over for her many years ago. It was the thought of returning to our bed that kept me fighting in the rough moments of the War, and now I was one task away from doing just that. 

We had deep conversations and the whole time I was distracted by that same beauty, but she was unaware of my true identity. She was kind to me as a beggar, offering hospitality but still skeptical of my origin. I knew my loyal wife would not be swayed by the suitors. 

After successfully executing the plan to get rid of the suitors (more on that in another post), it was time for the reveal. She ran downstairs from the news and made eye contact with me, still skeptical of a familiar face that hasn’t crossed her path in two decades. 

I was a little disappointed that she didn’t immediately welcome me with open arms. I’ve been longing for that delicate hug for all these years. She needed to test me with knowledge only the real Odysseus would know, and I immediately thought of our beautiful bed crafted from an olive tree. Upon her hearing of that all the tension in my body relaxed as she engulfed me with the hug worth fighting for. 

Our tears mixed and the long awaited kiss of return felt so good. I promised to never leave her side, vowing to spend the rest of my years at her service in our city. We would’ve hugged each other for an eternity if it hadn't been for Athena’s intervention, so we went back to our marriage bed. We stayed up all night talking about our stories until sweet sleep released me of all my worries, the best rest in 20 years.

### The Bonds That Endure

Returning to Ithaca has been a full circle moment, one that reminded me of what I fought for—my family, my city, and the life I left behind. Telemachus has now reached adulthood and is ready for the life ahead of him with his strength and grit, and Penelope, my beloved and loyal wife, remains the heart of this home that kept me going through years of suffering. 

No matter how far life takes you or how hard it gets, the bonds of love and family is what keeps you fighting. The years of pain and hardship were worth it. At last, I am home.
