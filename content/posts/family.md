### Voyage [^1]

After turning my men into pigs, the sorceress Circe tasked me with a journey no man has done before: to travel to the house of Hades by ship. She told me I must seek the blind prophet Tiresias for his advice on my homecoming. I wept, knowing that this task would not be possible, but Circe affirmed my resourcefulness and advised me to let the wind blow me to the shores of the Underworld. And so I did.

### Confronting Shadows [^2]

I made it to the Land of the Dead. My men and I traversed the eerie wasteland, and I made sure to bring the finest black sheep for Tiresias. I dug a pit with my sword and slit the sheep’s throat. The darkest blood was pouring from its neck and the souls of the past lives came gathering around. I drew my sword to keep them at bay until I met the blind prophet. The sight was haunting: the spirits of fallen soldiers still dressed in battle armor, young boys and girls whose lives were cut short, men and women in old age, and countless others, all united in death.

### Echoes of the Past [^3]

I was able to emotionally distance myself from the spirits until I started recognizing some of them. The first being Elpenor, one of my men who outlasted the War. I had no idea he died on Circe’s island, and the initial sight of him was like a blow to the chest. It’s the feeling when your day is going fine up until the moment you receive unexpecting news. I wept, and the tears didn’t stop flowing until I left the tragic Underworld.

The tears fell even more when I saw, with my own eyes, the spirit of my mother. I had the opportunity to speak to her, and I bombarded her with questions about her death. I thought she had died of sickness as would be reasonable for someone of her age, but when she told me she died grieving my absence I could not bear to stay in the Underworld any longer. I continued weeping tears of pity. She succumbed to the grief of my absence during the Trojan War. I should’ve come home sooner. I took too long. It’s my fault she died. 

I tried everything I could do to embrace her comfort one last time. I reached out, yearning for the warmth of her hug as I remembered it when I left for the War, but in each attempt her ghost slipped right through me, leaving a chilly breeze where her warmth once lingered. I never got the chance to say goodbye, and it will haunt me for the rest of my life. **Take the time to hug your loved ones, because you never know when it will be the last time you see them.**

Next came the spirit of my brother in arms, Agamemnon, whom I had the pleasure of fighting with during the War. He began weeping upon seeing me, and I had no option but to do the same, especially after seeing his desperate attempt to touch me. When the last time you see someone is when they are alive, you have the curiosity to ask them many questions when the next time you see them is in death, and so I did. I asked Agamemnon about his passing, thinking he didn’t make it home. But when I learned of the horror of his wife’s affair and betrayal, it gave me second thoughts on returning home. 

I don’t blame my wife if she had married another man, many would assume that a man would not return home after 20 years of absence. But I knew she would be able to resist temptation as my mother and Agamemnon reassured me. Then came Achilles, the strongest and handsomest of us, who sadly didn’t outlast the War. Fate struck him, and seeing a friend who was once so great look so small and shriveled made me shed tears of pity. 

### Lessons from the Underworld

This journey to the Underworld stands out from the rest, serving as a reminder of the fragility of life and to embrace the ones you love. I left the Underworld carrying the weight of their stories, wisdom, and sacrifices. Although I will never be able to see them again, I am reminded to cherish every moment I have with those still with me and to be grateful for landing home in Ithaca.
