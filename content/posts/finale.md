### Tipping Point [^1]

After enduring enough abuse in my own home from the treacherous suitors, the time had come to leave my mark and take back what’s rightfully mine. With the help of Athena we planned an archery contest through my wife Penelope, where the winner gets to take her hand in marriage. 

Of course no suitors could match my raw strength, so it is all a ploy to finally rid of all the parasites in my home and from my family. They’ve exhausted all of my resources and made a fool of my home, so it is only right I deplete them of their pathetic lives. I was told by fate that this day would come, and what a blessing it is to execute this final act beside my son—his first real test.

As predicted, no suitor was strong enough to string the bow and shoot it through all the axes but me. I ripped off my rags to reveal my true form and aimed my next shot at Antinous, a suitor whose abuse I had enough of. I fired the arrow and bloodshed commenced.

### Echoes of War

My hands were full of blood, a sight I haven’t seen since the brutal days of the Trojan War. To this day I still endure painful moments where I feel as though I am reliving those harrowing days. Taking life is never easy, no matter the circumstances or how many times it has been done. 

I may appear composed, but when I am alone in my thoughts the horrors resurface. Flashbacks cause me to seize up and nightmares pull me back to the same battlefield where life was mercilessly taken. Even in the comfort of my marriage bed, where I should be sleeping in peace, I sometimes awaken in a cold sweat with my heart racing as though I still hold my sword. 

I had no choice but to kill those suitors to protect my family and reclaim my throne. But the weight of my actions that day and in the War will never leave me. It lingers, silently tormenting and reminding me that war never truly ends for those who are lucky enough to survive it.

### The Price of Victory

Although I sit in my throne once more, it was not without the cost of violence and bloodshed. The echoes of war remain, and I carry the battle scars that remind me of what was lost, but also what was gained: my home, my family, and the chance to *rebuild my life*.
