    Title: 10 + 10 Years
    Content: |
      Hi, I'm **Odysseus**. ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my page! Here's a bit about me:
      1. A leader of the Greeks during the Trojan War.
      2. Famous for my perilous 20-year journey back home to Ithaca:
          - 10 years fighting in the Trojan War.
          - 10 years enduring countless trials on my voyage home

      I made this blog to reflect on my journeyâ€”sharing the trials, tribulations, and lessons I learned on the way back to my throne.
