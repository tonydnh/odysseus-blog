    Title: ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my page!
    Content: I'm Odysseus. Most people know me as a leader of the Greeks during the Trojan War and for my perilous voyage back to home. I spent a long time away from home in Ithaca, 20 years to be exact (10 years at the war and 10 years coming back), so I made this blog to reflect on the journey and the trials and tribulations I endured on the way back to my throne.
