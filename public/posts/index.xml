      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-cyclopes&#34;&gt;The Cyclopes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After dragging my men back from the tempting lotus plants, we could not afford another detour. We needed to get back home. We sailed the grayish waters until we arrived at the land of the Cyclopes, the men and women who put their trust in gods and have no laws. They lack a second eye and their physique is like that of the gods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent the first night on the ship and when Dawn took the sky we set out to question their hospitality and fear of the gods. I brought my twelve most trustworthy men with me to a high cave occupied by one of these massive men. We waited until nightfall until the giant came home with a bundle of wood intended for fire. Huddled up in the corner, we waited until the Cyclops lit his fire and noticed our presence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
