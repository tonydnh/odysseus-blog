I brought my twelve most trustworthy men with me to a high cave occupied by one of these massive men. We waited until nightfall until the giant came home with a bundle of wood intended for fire. Huddled up in the corner, we waited until the Cyclops lit his fire and noticed our presence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
